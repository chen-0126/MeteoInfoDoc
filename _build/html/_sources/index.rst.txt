Introduction
=====================================

MeteoInfo is an open source software (LGPL license) suite, which includes two major applications:
``MeteoInfoMap`` and ``MeteoInfoLab``.

MeteoInfoMap was designed to view and analyze meteorological and
spatial data interactively. Some GIS functions were developed from ground level. It has two
editions: Java and C#. MeteoInfoMap may be run in Windows, Mac OS, Linux and Unix. MeteoInfoMap can
also be run automatically using MeteoInfoMap scripting with the Jython language (Java edition) or
IronPython language (C# edition). The main functions are packed in the MeteoInfo class library,
which could be used to conveniently develop the software.

MeteoInfoLab was developed using Java and Jython based on MeteoInfo Java
library (Unidata netCDF Java library is used). The purpose is to provide an optional scientific 
computation and visualization tool similar with MatLab and/or NCL.
