Introduction:
------------------------------------
Statistical analysis of air mass back trajectories combined with long-term ambient air pollution 
measurements are useful tools for source identification. Using these methods, the geographic 
information system (GIS) based software, TrajStat, was developed to view, query, and cluster 
the trajectories and compute the potential source contribution function (PSCF) and concentration 
weighted trajectory (CWT) analyses when measurement data are included.

The HYSPLIT model is used to calculate trajectories, which are loaded into the system as an external 
process. The trajectory files with three-dimensional endpoint data could be converted to the ESRI 
“PolylineZ” shape file format. In this type of shape file the x, y and z properties of each point 
are defined by its longitude, latitude and air pressure along the trajectory. The trajectories can 
be shown in various spatial patterns. For instance, using only the level (x, y) or height (z) 
coordinates, each trajectory can be shown as a two-dimensional figure. When combined height with 
longitude and latitude values, the three-dimensional trajectories can be plotted. The long-term 
measurement data could be assigned to their corresponding trajectories. A query function was 
developed to identify the trajectories to which a user can distinguish the polluted trajectories 
with high measurement concentration from a large number of trajectories and then the pollutant 
pathway could be roughly estimated. Euclidean distance or angle distance (Sirois and Bottenheim, 
1995) can be selected as the cluster model. A reasonable maximum cluster number can be decided 
through visual inspection and comparison of the mean-trajectory maps. The mean pollutant 
concentration for each cluster can be computed using the cluster statistics function. Pollutant 
pathways could then be associated with the high concentration clusters. After calculating the PSCF 
and CWT value, an arbitrary weight function (Polissar et al., 1999) is applied to reduce the 
uncertainty of cells with few endpoints. Then the potential source regions with high PSCF or CWT 
value could be identified.
