Introduction:
------------------------------------
The wContour class library was developed using Java and C# to implement the contour-related 
algorithms used in software development for data analysis in the geosciences using the Java or 
.NET environment. The comprehensive description of the algorithms for contour line tracing, 
filling and clipping of the complex grid data with many irregularly distributed undefined value 
points was given. Border lines were traced from beginning and contour polygons with holes were 
output finally. Inverse distance weighted (IDW) and Cressman objective analysis methods are 
provided for discrete data interpolation to grid data. Algorithms for contour line tracing, 
smoothing, filling and clipping are included to fulfil the contour functions from complex grid 
data. A streamline analysis method is also provided.
