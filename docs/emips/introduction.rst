Introduction
*******************

Emission Inventory Processing System (EMIPS) is a cross-platform toolbox based on Meteoinfo. The purpose of EMIPS is to convert the resolution of the emission inventory data to the resolution needed by an air quality model(AQM). Emission inventories are typically available with an annual-total emissions value for each emissions source. In order to meet the AQM's requirement of emissions data on an hourly basis for each model grid cell and for each model species, EMIPS is used to transforming an emission inventory data through temporal allocation, chemical speciation, and spatial allocation.You can get more information about EMIPS in examples and source code.
